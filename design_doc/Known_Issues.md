Waiting for:
    Style Library
    RAG Image DataBase 

Frontend: wrapped everything in electron java script later 

In @style/, update according to the style library

# TODO

Modify all design doc, prompt, and schema to keep it minimal for now, add details later based on the data/need/PRD

In @prompt/
    all the prompts should follow guidelines in PRD (10. Output Constraints), e.g. all sketch should be 15min human drawing
    Same update in @design_doc/Input_to_Prompt.md  
    Also need API key in env, use Placeholder for now 

Setup @pipeline.py and @main.py for CLI testing
