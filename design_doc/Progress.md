Let's refactor our designs docs based on some updates I made. One rule is to always remember when writing design docs is that you should write in a concise and brief way, do not include too many technical details, only include what are the functions we can use and what they do, what are the parameters, things like these. 

Reflect this new feature in @design_doc/
