# SWAG Concept Sketch Agent

An AI-powered design assistant that converts natural language ideas into rough, draw-over-ready concept sketches. Built for Swag's licensed design pipeline, it uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with designer-curated reference images to produce sketches that match exact stylistic guidelines — accelerating early-stage concept throughput while preserving designer control.
